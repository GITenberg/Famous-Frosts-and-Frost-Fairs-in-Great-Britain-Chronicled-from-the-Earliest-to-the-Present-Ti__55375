<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The aim of this book is to furnish a reliable account of remarkable
frosts occurring in this country from the earliest period in
our Annals to the present time. In many instances, I have given
particulars as presented by contemporary writers of the scenes and
circumstances described.</p>

<p>In the compilation of this Chronology, several hundred books,
magazines, and newspapers, have been consulted, and a complete list
would fill several pages. I must not, however, omit to state that I
have derived much valuable information from a scarce book printed
on the Ice of the River Thames, in the year 1814, and published under
the title of “Frostiana.” I have gleaned information from the late
Mr. Cornelius Walford’s “Famines of the World,” which includes a
carefully prepared summary of “The Great Frosts of History.”
Some of the poems in my pages, bibliographical notes and facts, are
culled from Dr. Rimbault’s “Old Ballads Illustrating the Great Frost
of 1683-4,” issued by the Percy Society. It will be also observed
that I have drawn curious information from Parish Registers and old
Parish Accounts.</p>

<p>Several ladies and gentlemen have rendered me great assistance,
and amongst the number must be named, with gratitude, Mrs. George
Linnæus Banks, author of “The Manchester Man;” Mr. Jesse Quail,
<span class="smcapuc">F.S.S.</span>, editor of the <cite>Northern Daily Telegraph</cite>; Mr. C. H. Stephenson,
actor, author, and antiquary; Mr W. H. K. Wright, <span class="smcapuc">F.R.H.S.</span>, editor of
the <cite>Western Antiquary</cite>; Mr. W. G. B. Page, of the Hull Subscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Library; Mr. Frederick Ross, <span class="smcapuc">F.R.H.S.</span>, and Mr. Ernest E. Baker, editor
of the “Somersetshire Reprints.” Mr. E. H. Coleman kindly prepared
for me a long list of books and magazines containing articles
on this subject. I have to thank Mr. Mason Jackson, the author of
“The Pictorial Press,” for kindly presenting to me the quaint cut
which appears on page 29 of my work.</p>

<p>In 1881, the greater part of the matter contained in this book
appeared in the <cite>Bradford Times</cite>, a well-conducted journal, under the
able editorship of Mr. W. H. Hatton, <span class="smcapuc">F.R.H.S.</span> The articles attracted
more than local attention, and I was pressed to reproduce them in a
volume, but owing to various circumstances, I have not been able
to comply with the request until now. The record is now brought
up to date, and many facts and particulars, gleaned since the articles
appeared, have been added.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1076-7</div>

<p>Frost lasted from 1st November, 1076, to 15th
April, 1077. It is recorded in the “Harleian
Miscellany,” iii, page 167, that: “In the
tenth year of his [William the Conqueror] reign,
the cold of winter was exceeding memorable, both
for sharpness and for continuance; for the earth
remained hard from the beginning of November
until the midst of April then ensuing.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1086</div>

<p>According to Walford’s “Insurance Cyclopædia,”
“The weather was so inclement that in the unusual
efforts made to warm the houses, nearly all
the chief cities of the kingdom were destroyed
by fire, including a great part of London and St.
Paul’s.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1092</div>

<p>In this year occurred a famous frost, and it is stated,
in the quaint language of an old chronicler, that
“the great streams [of England] were congealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in such a manner that they could draw two
hundred horsemen and carriages over them; whilst
at their thawing, many bridges, both of wood and
stone, were borne down, and divers water-mills
were broken up and carried away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1095-99</div>

<p>Very severe winters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1114-15</div>

<p>The following is from an “Old Chronicle:” “Great
frost; timber bridges broken down by weight of
ice. This year was the winter so severe with
snow and frost, that no man who was then living
ever remembered one more severe; in consequence
of which there was great destruction of
cattle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1121-22</div>

<p>A severe frost killed the grain crops. A famine
followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1128</div>

<p>Very severe frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1149-50</div>

<p>Frost lasted from 10th December to 19th February.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1154</div>

<p>A great frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1176</div>

<p>A frost lasted from Christmas to Candlemas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1205</div>

<p>In Stow’s “Chronicle,” it is recorded that on the 14th
day of January, 1205, “began a frost which continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
till the 20th day of March, so that no
ground could be tilled; whereof it came to passe
that, in the summer following, a quarter of wheat
was sold for a mark of silver in many places of
England, which for the most part, in the days of
King Henry II., was sold for twelve pence; a
quarter of oats for forty pence, that were wont to
be sold for fourpence. Also the money was so
sore clipped that there was no remedy but to have
it renewed.” Short states, “Frozen ale and wine
sold by weight.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1207</div>

<p>Fifteen weeks’ frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1209</div>

<p>A long and hard winter followed by dearth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1221</div>

<p>Severe frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1226</div>

<p>Severe frost and snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1233</div>

<p>Frost lasted until Candlemas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1234-35</div>

<p>Penkethman gives the following particulars of
this frost: “18 Henry III. was a great frost at
Christmasse, which destroyed the corne in the
ground, and the roots and hearbs in the gardens,
continuing till Candlemasse without any snow, so
that no man could plough the ground, and all the
yeare after was unseasonable weather, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
barrenesse of all things ensued, and many poor
folks died for the want of victualls, the rich being
so bewitched with avarice that they could yield
them no reliefe.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1241</div>

<p>A great frost after a heavy fall of snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1250</div>

<p>Very severe frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1254</div>

<p>A severe frost from 1st January to 14th March.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1263</div>

<p>On St. Nicholas’s Day a month’s hard frost set in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1269</div>

<p>A frost lasted from 30th November to the 2nd
February.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1281-2</div>

<p>“From Christmas to the Purification of Our
Lady, there was such a frost and snow as no
man living could remember the like: where,
through five arches of London Bridge, and all
Rochester Bridge, were borne downe and carried
away by the streame; and the like hapned to
many other bridges in England. And, not long
after, men passed over the Thames between Westminster
and Lambeth dryshod.”&mdash;Stow, edited by
Howes, 1631.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1288</div>

<p>Great frost and snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1337</div>

<p>Severe frost without snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1338</div>

<p>Twelve weeks’ frost, after rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1353</div>

<p>A frost from 6th December to 12th March.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1363-64</div>

<p>“Very terrible” frost from 16th September to 6th
April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1407</div>

<p>A frost lasted fourteen weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1410</div>

<p>It is recorded in the “Chronicles of the Grey Friars
of London,” as follows: “Thys yere was the
grete frost and ise, and most sharpest winter that
ever man sawe, and it duryd fourteen wekes, so
that men myght in dyvers places both goo and
ryde over the Temse.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1434-35</div>

<p>Stow records that the Thames was frozen, from
below London Bridge to Gravesend, from December
25th to February 10th, when the merchandise
which came to the Thames mouth was carried to
London by land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1438</div>

<p>A long frost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1506</div>

<p>We find this entry in the “Chronicles of Grey Friars
of London”: “Such a sore snowe and a frost that
men myght goo with carttes over the Temse and
horses, and it lastyed tylle Candlemas.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1515</div>

<p>The Thames frozen, and carts crossed on the ice to
and from Lambeth to Westminster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523</div>

<p>Very severe frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1564-65</div>

<p>Interesting particulars of this severe frost are
given in Stow’s “Annals,” and Holinshed’s
“Chronicle.” The latter historian says that the
frost continued to such an extremity that, on New
Year’s Eve, “People went over and alongst the
Thames on the ise, from London Bridge to Westminster.
Some plaied at the football as boldlie there,
as if it had been on the drie land; divers of the court
being then at Westminster, shot dailie at prickes set
upon the Thames; and the people, both men and
women, went on the Thames in greater numbers
than in anie street of the Citie of London. On
the third daie of January, at night, it began to
thaw, and on the fifth there was no ise to be seene
betweene London Bridge and Lambeth, which
sudden thaw caused great floods, and high
waters, that bare downe bridges and houses, and
drowned manie people in England, especiallie in
Yorkshire. Owes Bridge was borne awaie, with
others.” There is a tradition that Queen Elizabeth
walked upon the ice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1607</div>

<p>An old tradition still lingers in Derbyshire, respecting
the famous Bess of Hardwick, to the
effect that a fortune teller told her that her
death would not happen as long as she continued
building. She caused to be erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
several noble structures, including Hardwick and
Chatsworth, two of the most stately homes of
old England. Her death occurred in the year 1607,
during a very severe frost, when the
workmen could not continue their labours,
although they tried to mix their mortar with
hot ale.</p>

<p>Malt liquor in the days of yore was believed
to add to the durability of mortar, and items
bearing on this subject occur in parish accounts.

<p>Many of the old parish accounts contain items
similar to the foregoing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1607</div>

<p>The following is an abstract from Drake’s “Eboracum;
or, the History and Antiquities of York;”
“About Martinmass (1607) began an extream frost;
the river Ouze was wholly frozen up, so hard
that you might have passed with cart and carriage
as well as upon firm ground. Many
sports were practised upon the ice, as shooting at
eleven score, says my ancient authority, bowling,
playing at football, cudgels, &amp;c. And a horse-race
was run from the tower at S. Mary[’s] Gate End
along and under the great arch of the bridge to the
Crain at Skeldergate postern.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1608</div>

<p>This year a frost fair was held upon the Thames.
Edmund Howes, in his “Continuation of the
Abridgement of Stow’s English Chronicle,” 1611,
p. 481, gives the following curious account of it:
“The 8th of December began a hard frost, and
continued untill the 15th of the same, and then
thawed; the 22nd of December it began againe
to freeze violently, so as divers persons went
halfe way over the Thames upon the ice: and
the 30th of December, at every ebbe, for the flood
removed the ice, and forced the people daily to
tread new paths, except only betweene Lambeth
and the ferry at Westminster, the which, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
incessant treading, became very firm, and free
passage, untill the great thaw: and from Sunday,
the tenth of January, untill the fifteenth of the
same, the frost grew so extreme, as the ice became
firme, and removed not, and then all sorts of men,
women, and children, went boldly upon the ice in
most parts; some shot at prickes, others bowled and
danced, with other variable pastimes; by reason of
which concourse of people were many that set up
boothes and standings upon the ice, as fruit-sellers,
victuallers, that sold beere and wine, shoemakers,
and a barber’s tent, etc.” It is also stated that the
tents &amp;c. had fires in them. The artichokes in the
gardens about London were killed by the frost. The
ice lasted until the afternoon of the 2nd of February.
Gough presented to the Bodleian Library, a rare
tract containing a wood-cut representation of the
Thames in its frozen state, with a view of London
Bridge in the distance. It is entitled: “Cold
Doings in London, except it be at the Lottery,
with Newes out of the Country. A familliar talk
between a Countryman and a Citizen, touching
this terrible Frost, and the Great Lottery, and
the effect of them.” London, 1608, quarto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1609</div>

<p>Great frost commenced in October, and lasted four
months. The Thames frozen, and heavy carriages
driven over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1614</div>

<p>It is recorded in Drake’s “Eboracum” as follows:
“On the 16th of January the same year [1614] it
began to snow and freeze, and so by intervals
snowing without any thaw till the 7th of March
following; at which time was such a heavy snow
upon the earth as was not remembered by any
man then living. It pleased God that at the
thaw fell very little rain, nevertheless the flood
was so great, that the Ouze ran down North
Street and Skeldergate with such violence as to
force all the inhabitants of those streets to leave
their houses. This inundation chanced to happen
in the Assize week, John Armitage, Esquire,
being then High Sheriff of Yorkshire. Business
was hereby much obstructed; at Ouze bridge
end were four boats continually employed in carrying
people [a]cross the river; the like in Walmgate
[a]cross the Foss. Ten days this inundation
continued at the height, and many bridges were
driven down by it in the country, and much land
overflown. After this storm, says my manuscript,
followed such fair and dry weather, that in April
the ground was as dusty as in any time of summer.
This drought continued till the 20th of
August following without any rain at all; and
made such a scarcity of hay, beans, and barley,
that the former was sold at York for 30s. and 40s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a wayne load, and at Leeds for four pounds.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1615</div>

<p>A severe frost from the 17th January to 7th March.
In 1814 a tract was republished entitled “The
Cold Yeare: a Deep Snow in which Men and
Cattle perished; written in Dialogue between a
London Shopkeeper and a North-countryman.”

<p>“This year a frost enabled the Londoners to carry
on all manner of sports and trades upon the river.”
“Old and New London,” by E. Walford, M.A.,
v 3, p. 312.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1634</div>

<p>Says a contributor to “Notes and Queries” in the
<cite>Nottingham Guardian</cite>, the following is an extract
from Prynne’s “Divine Tragedie lately acted,”
1636:&mdash;“On January the 25th, 1634, being the
Lord’s Day, in the time of the last great frost,
fourteen young men, presuming to play at football
on the river Trent, near Gainsborough, coming
altogether in a scuffle, the ice suddenly broke, and
there were eight of them drowned.” The “Divine
Tragedie,” like several other works of that period,
was written to show how judgments were overtaking
the people because of the recent order
that the Book of Liberty should be read in
churches, which legalised sports on Sunday after
service.</p>

<p>John Evelyn wrote in his “Diary;” “Now was
the Thames frozen over, and horrid tempests of
wind.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1663</div>

<p>From the 28th January to 11th February, severe
frost. Samuel Pepys records in his “Diary,” “8th
February being very hard frost; 28th August,
cold all night and this morning, and a very great
frost they say, abroad; which is much, having
had no summer at all, almost.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1664-65</div>

<p>Severe frost from 28th December to 7th February.
Pepys says, 6 February: “One of the
coldest days, they say, ever felt in England.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1672</div>

<p>In the December of 1672 occurred in the West of
England, an uncommon kind of shower of freezing
rain, or raining ice. It is recorded that this rain,
as soon as it touched anything above ground, as
a bough or the like, immediately settled into ice;
and by multiplying and enlarging the icicles
broke down with its weight. The rain that fell
on the snow immediately froze into ice, without
sinking in the snow at all. It made an incredible
destruction of trees, beyond anything in all
history. “Had it concluded with some gust of
wind” says a gentleman on the spot, “it might
have been of terrible consequence. I weighed
the sprig of an ash tree, of just three quarters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a pound, the ice of which weighed sixteen pounds.
Some were frighted with the noise of the air till
they discerned it was the clatter of icy boughs
dashed against each other.” Dr. Beale says, that
there was no considerable frost observed on the
ground during the whole time; whence he concludes
that a frost may be very intense and dangerous on
the tops of some hills and plains; while in other
places, it keeps at two, three or four feet distance
above the ground, rivers, lakes, &amp;c. The frost
was followed by a forwardness of flowers and
fruits.</p>

<p>The foregoing appears to have escaped the
notice of the compiler of an interesting and informing
little book entitled “Odd Showers.”
London, 1870.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1683-84</div>

<p>From the beginning of December until the 5th
of February, to use the words of Maitland, frost
“congealed the river Thames to that degree, that
another city, as it were, was erected thereon;
where, by the great number of streets and shops,
with their rich furniture, it represented a great
fair, with a variety of carriages, and diversions of
all sorts; and near Whitehall a whole ox was
roasted on the ice.” Evelyn gives perhaps the
best account of this’ great frost. Writing in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“Diary” under date of January 24th, 1684, he
observes, “the frost continuing more and more
severe, the Thames before London, was still
planted with boothes in formal streetes, all sorts
of trades and shops furnish’d and full of commodities,
even to a printing presse, where the
people and ladyes tooke a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and yeare set down
when printed on the Thames: this humour tooke
so universally, that ’twas estimated the printer
gain’d £5 a day, for printing a line onely, at sixpence
a name, besides what he got by ballads,
etc. Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other staires, to and
fro, as in the streetes, sleds, sliding with skeetes,
a bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet-plays,
and interludes, cookes, tipling, and other
lewd places, so that it seem’d to be a bacchanalian
triumph, or carnival on the water.” Evelyn
tells how the traffic and festivity were continued
until February the 5th, when he states
that “it began to thaw, but froze again. My
coach crossed from Lambeth to the horse-ferry,
at Milbank, Westminster. The boothes were
almost all taken downe, but there was just a map,
or landskip, cut in copper, representing all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
manner of the camp, and the several actions,
sports, pastimes, thereon, in memory of so signal
a frost.”</p>

<p>King Charles visited the sports on the Thames,
in company with members of his family and of
the royal household. They had their names
printed on a quarto sheet of Dutch paper,
measuring three and a half inches by four. The
following is a copy of the interesting document:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the foregoing list of names we have Charles

afterwards James the Second; Queen Catherine,
Infanta of Portugal; Mary D’Este, sister of
Francis, Duke of Modena, James’s second duchess;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Princess Anne, second daughter of the Duke
of York, afterwards Queen Anne; and her
husband Prince George of Denmark. It has been
suggested that the last name displays a touch of
the King’s humour, and signifies “Jack in the

Anne of Denmark.</p>

<p>In some quaint lines, entitled “Thamasis’s

<p>Landskip, mentioned by Evelyn, is entitled “An

Boothes, and all the Varieties of Showes and
Humours upon the Ice, on the River of Thames
by London, during that memorable Frost, 35th
yeare of the Reign of his Sacred Majesty King
Charles the Second. Anno Dni <span class="smcapuc">MDCLXXXIII</span>.

copper-plate engraving, the view extending from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the Temple-stairs and Bankside to London-bridge.
In an oval cartouche at the top within the frame
of the print, is the title; and below the frame are
the alphabetical references, with the words
“Printed and sold by William Warter, Stationer,
at the signe of the Talbott, under the Mitre
Tavern in Fleete street, London.” In the foreground
of this representation of Frost Fair appear
extensive circles of spectators surrounding a bull-baiting,
and the rapid revolution of a whirling-chair
or car, drawn by several men, by a long rope
fastened to a stake fixed in the ice. Large boats,
covered with tilts, capable of containing a considerable
number of passengers, and decorated
with flags and streamers, are represented as being
used for sledges, some being drawn by horses, and
others by watermen, lacking their usual employment.
Another sort of boat was mounted on
wheels; and one vessel, called “the drum boat,”
was distinguished by a drummer placed at the
prow. The pastimes of throwing at a cock,
sliding and skating, roasting an ox, football,
skittles, pigeon-holes, cups and balls, &amp;c., are
represented as being carried on in various parts
of the river; whilst a sliding-hutch, propelled by a
stick; a chariot, moved by a screw; and stately
coaches filled with visitors, appear to be rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
moving in various directions, and sledges with
coals and wood are passing between London and
Southwark shores. An impression of this plate
will be found in the Royal Collection of Topographical
Prints and Drawings, given by George
the Fourth to the British Museum, vol. xxvii.,
art. 39. There is also a variation of the same
engraving in the City Library at Guildhall, divided
with common ink into compartments, as if intended
to be used as cards, and numbered in the
margin, in type with Roman numerals, in sets of
ten each, with two extra.</p>

ADMIRATION.</p>

<p class="noindent">Being a true Representation of a prodigious Frost, which
began about the beginning of December, 1683, and continued
till the fourth day of February following, and held on with
such violence, that men and beasts, coaches and carts, went
as frequently thereon, as boats were wont to pass before.
There was also a street of booths built from the Temple to
Southwark, where were sold all sorts of goods imaginable,
namely, cloaths, plate, earthenware, meat, drink, brandy,
tobacco, and a hundred sorts of other commodities not here
inserted: it being the wonder of this present age, and a
great consternation to all the spectators.</p>

<div class="verse">And sholes of people every where there be,</div>

<div class="verse">Another crys, Here master, they but scoff ye,</div>
<div class="verse">Here is a dish of famous new made coffee.</div>
<div class="verse">And some do say a giddy senseless ass</div>
<div class="verse">May on the Thames be furnished with a lass;</div>
<div class="verse">But, to be short, such wonders there are seen,</div>
<div class="verse">That in this age before hath never been.</div>
<div class="verse">Before the Temple there a street is made,</div>
<div class="verse">And there is one almost of every trade:</div>
<div class="verse">There may you also this hard frosty winter,</div>
<div class="verse">See on the rocky ice a working printer,</div>
<div class="verse">Who hopes by his own heart to reap some gain,</div>
<div class="verse">Which he perchance does think he may obtain.</div>
<div class="verse">Here is also a lottery, and musick too,</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, a cheating, drunken, leud, and debauch’d crew.</div>
<div class="verse">Hot codlins, pancakes, duck, goose and sack,</div>
<div class="verse">Rabit, capon, hen, turkey, and a wooden jack.</div>
<div class="verse">In this same street before the Temple made,</div>
<div class="verse">There seems to be a brisk and lively trade:</div>
<div class="verse">Where ev’ry booth hath such a cunning sign,</div>
<div class="verse">As seldome hath been seen in former time;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And there, if you have money for to spend,</div>
<div class="verse">Each cunning snap will seem to be your friend.</div>
<div class="verse">There may you see small vessels under sail,</div>
<div class="verse">All’s one to them, with or against the gale,</div>
<div class="verse">And as they pass they little guns do fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Which feedeth some, and puffs them with desire</div>
<div class="verse">To sail therein, and when their money’s gone,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis right, they cry, the Thames to come upon.</div>
<div class="verse">There on a sign you may most plainly see’t,</div>
<div class="verse">Here’s the first tavern built in Freezeland-street:</div>
<div class="verse">There is bull-baiting and bear-baiting too,</div>
<div class="verse">That no man living yet e’re found so true;</div>
<div class="verse">And foot-ball play is there so common grown,</div>
<div class="verse">That on the Thames before was never known;</div>
<div class="verse">Coals being dear, are carry’d on men’s backs,</div>
<div class="verse">And some on sledges these are drawn in sacks;</div>
<div class="verse">Men do on horse-back ride from shore to shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Which formerly in boats were wafted o’re:</div>
<div class="verse">Poor people hard shifts make for livelihoods,</div>
<div class="verse">And happy are if they can sell their goods;</div>
<div class="verse">What you can buy for three-pence on the shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Will cost you four-pence on the Thames or more.</div>
<div class="verse">Now let me come to things more strange, yet true,</div>
<div class="verse">And question not what I declare to you;</div>
<div class="verse">There rosted was a great and well-fed oxe,</div>
<div class="verse">And there, with dogs, hunted the cunning fox;</div>
<div class="verse">Dancing o’th’ ropes, and puppit plays likewise,</div>
<div class="verse">The like before ne’er seen beneath the skies;</div>
<div class="verse">All stand admir’d, and very well they may,</div>
<div class="verse">To see such pastimes, and such sort of play.</div>
<div class="verse">Besides the things I nam’d to you before,</div>
<div class="verse">There other toys and baubles are great store;</div>
<div class="verse">There you may feast your wandring eyes enough,</div>
<div class="verse">There you may buy a box to hold your snuff.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<div class="verse">No fair no market underneath the skies</div>
<div class="verse">That can afford you more varieties;</div>
<div class="verse">There you may see some hundreds slide in skeets,</div>
<div class="verse">And beaten paths like to the city streets.</div>
<div class="verse">There were Dutch whimsies turned swiftly round</div>
<div class="verse">Faster then horses run on level ground.</div>
<div class="verse">The like to this I now to you do tell</div>
<div class="verse">No former age could ever parallel;</div>
<div class="verse">There’s all that can supply most curious minds,</div>
<div class="verse">With such varieties of cunning signs</div>
<div class="verse">That I do think no man doth understand;</div>
<div class="verse">Such merry fancies ne’r were on the land;</div>
<div class="verse">There is such whimsies on the frozen ice,</div>
<div class="verse">Make some believe the Thames a Paridice.</div>
<div class="verse">And though these sights be to our admiration</div>
<div class="verse">Yet our sins, our sins, do call for lamentation.</div>
<div class="verse">Though such unusual frosts to us are strange,</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps it may predict some greater change;</div>
<div class="verse">And some do fear may a fore-runner be</div>
<div class="verse">Of an approaching sad mortality:</div>
<div class="verse">But why should we to such belief incline?</div>
<div class="verse">There’s none that knows but the blest Pow’r divine</div>
<div class="verse">And whatsoe’re is from Jehovah sent,</div>
<div class="verse">Poor sinners ought therewith to be content;</div>
<div class="verse">If dreadfull, then to fall upon the knee,</div>
<div class="verse">And beg remission of the Deity;</div>
<div class="verse">But if beyond our thoughts he sends us store,</div>
<div class="verse">With all our hearts let’s thankful be therefore.</div>
<div class="verse">Now let us all in great Jehovah trust</div>
<div class="verse">Who doth preserve the righteous and the just;</div>
<div class="verse">And eke conclude sin is the cause of all</div>
<div class="verse">The heavy judgments that on us do fall:</div>

<div class="verse">Nor are deceived by the alluring bait.</div>
<div class="verse">The watermen with folded arms doe stand,</div>

<div class="verse">Their boats hal’d up, their oars laid useless by,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor oars, nor skuller, master, do they cry,</div>

<div class="verse">Would once more launch their boat and fill their sail;</div>

<p>In the parish register of Holy-rood Church,
Southampton, is the following record of this
winter’s remarkable frost:</p>

<p>“1683-4 This yeare was a great Frost, which
began before Christmasse, soe that yᵉ 3rd and 4th
dayes of this month February yᵉ River of Southampton
was frossen all over and covered with ice
from Calshott Castle to Redbridge and Tho:
Martaine maʳ of a vessell went upon yᵉ ice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Berry near Marchwood to Milbrook-point. And
yᵉ river at Ichen Ferry was so frossen over that
severall persons went from Beauvois-hill to Bittern
Farme, forwards and backwards.”</p>

<p>The following curious extract is from the Parochial
Register at Ubley, near Wrington: “In the
yeare 1683 was a mighty great frost, the like was
not seene in England for many ages. It came
upon a very deep snow, which fell imediately after
Christmas, and it continued untill a Lady-day.
The ground was not open nor the snow cleane
gone off the earth in thirteene weeks. Somm of
the snow remained at mindipe till midsummer. It
was soe deepe and driven with the winde a gainst
the hedges and stiles, that the next morning after
it fell men could not goe to their grounds to serve
their cattell without great danger of being buried,
for it was above head and shoulders in many places&mdash;sum
it did burie&mdash;did betooken the burieing of
many more which came to pass before the end of
the yeare; but in few days the frost came soe
fearce, that people did goe upon the top of it over
wals and stiles as on levell ground, not seeing
hardly where they was, and many men was forced
to keep their cattell untill the last, in the same
ground that they was in at first, because they
could not drive them to any other place, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hew the ice every day for water, by reason of the
sharpness of the frost and the deepness of the
snow. Som that was travelling on mindipe did
travell till they could travell no longer, and then
lye down and dye, but mortality did prevaill most
among them that could travell worst, the sharpness
of the season tooke off the most parte of them that
was aged and of them that was under infermities,
the people did die so fast, that it was the greatest
parte of their work (which was appointed to doe
that worke) to burie the dead; it being a day’s
work for two men, or two days’ work for one man,
to make a grave. It was almost as hard a work
to hew a grave out, in the earth, as in the rock,
the frost was a foot and halfe and two foot deepe
in the dry earth, and where there was moister and
watter did runn, the ice was a yard and fower foot
thick, in soe much that ye people did keepe
market on the River at London; ‘God doth
scatter his ice like morsels, man cannot abide his
cold.’&mdash;Psalme, 147, 17.”</p>

<p>The following are particulars of the chief publications
issued in connection with this frost:&mdash;</p>

<p>A large copper-plate, entitled “A Map of the River
Thames, merrily call’d Blanket Fair, as it was
frozen in the memorable year 1683-4, describing
the booths, footpaths, coaches, sledges, bull-baiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and other remarks upon that famous
river.” Dedicated to Sir Henry Hulse, Knt., and
Lord Mayor, by James Moxon, the engraver.</p>

<p>“A wonderfull Fair, or a Fair of Wonders; being
new and true illustration and description of the
several things acted and done on the river of
Thames in the time of the terrible frost, which
began about the beginning of Dec., 1683, and continued
till Feb. 4, and held on with such violence,
that men and beasts, coaches and sledges, went
common thereon. There was also a street of
booths from the Temple to Southwark, where was
sold all sorts of goods; likewise bull-baiting and
an ox roasted whole, and many other things, as
the map and description do plainly show.”

<p>Timbs, in his “Curiosities of London,” records a
great frost, lasting from 20th December to 6th
February. Pools were frozen eighteen inches
thick, and the Thames ice was covered with streets
of shops, bull-baiting, shows and tricks; hackney
coaches plied on the ice-roads, and a coach with
six horses was driven from Whitehall almost to
London Bridge; yet in two days all the ice
disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>The Thames frozen over, and some persons crossed
it on the ice. In the Crowle Pennant is a coarse
bill, within a wood-cut border of rural subjects,
bearing the inscription, “Mr. John Heaton,
printed on the Thames at Westminster, January
7th, 1709.” The frost lasted three months. It is
somewhat remarkable to find that there was very
little frost this year in Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715-16</div>

<p>Thames again frozen over. At the time of this
frost an advertisement appeared as follows: “This
is to give notice to gentlemen and others that pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
upon the Thames during this frost, that over
against Whitehall-stairs they may have their
names printed, fit to paste in any book, to hand
down the memory of the season to future ages.</p>

<div class="verse">For such a year as this, has seldom been.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following account of this frost is drawn
from <cite>Dawks’s News-Letter</cite> of January 14th, 1716:
“The Thames seems now a solid rock of ice; and
booths for the sale of brandy, wine, ale, and other
exhilarating liquors, have been for some time fixed
thereon; but now it is in a manner like a town:
thousands of people cross it, and with wonder
view the mountainous heaps of water, that now
lie congealed into ice. On Thursday, a great
cook’s-shop was erected, and gentlemen went as
frequently to dine there, as at any ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Over against Westminster, Whitehall, and
Whitefriars, Printing-presses are kept upon the
ice, where many persons have their names printed,
to transmit the wonders of the season to posterity.”</p>

<p>It is further recorded of the Thames that
“coaches, waggons, carts, &amp;c., were driven
on it, and an enthusiastic preacher held forth
to a motley congregation on the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
waters, with a zeal fiery enough to have thawed
himself through the ice, had it been susceptible to
religious warmth. This, with other pastimes and
diversions, attracted the attention of many of the
nobility, and even brought the Prince of Wales,
to visit Frost Fair. On that day, there was an
uncommonly high spring-tide, which overflowed
the cellars on the banks of the river, and raised
the ice full fourteen feet, without interrupting the
people from their pursuits. The <cite>Protestant Packet</cite>
of this period, observes that the theatres were
almost deserted. The <cite>News-letter</cite> of February 15,
announces the dissolution of the ice, and with it
the ‘baseless fabric’ on which Momus had held
his temporary reign; the above paper then proclaims
the good fare, and various articles to be
seen, and purchased.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739-40</div>

<p>The winter of 1739-40 was one of great severity.
The frost commenced on Christmas-day, and
lasted until the 17th February following. It
caused much distress amongst the poor, coals
could hardly be obtained for money, and water
was equally scarce. It is recorded that “the
watermen and fishermen, with a peterboat in
mourning, and the carpenters, bricklayers, &amp;c.,
with their tools and utensils in mourning, walked
through the streets in large bodies, imploring
relief for their own and families’ necessities; and,
to the honour of the British character, this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
liberally bestowed. Subscriptions were also
made in the different parishes, and great benefactions
bestowed by the opulent, through which
the calamities of the season were much mitigated.
A few days after the frost had set in, great damage
was done among the shipping in the river Thames
by a high wind, which broke many vessels from
their moorings, and drove them foul of each other,
while the large sheets of ice that floated on the
stream, overwhelmed various boats and lighters,
and sunk several corn and coal vessels. By these
accidents many lives were lost; and many others
were also destroyed by the intensity of the cold,
both on land and water.</p>

<p>Above the Bridge, the Thames was completely
frozen over, and tents and numerous booths were
erected on it for selling liquors, &amp;c., to the multitudes
that daily flocked thither for curiosity or
diversion. The scene here displayed was very
irregular, and had more the appearance of a fair
on land, than of a frail exhibition, the only basis
of which was congealed water.”</p>

<p>Sports were enjoyed on the ice, and shops
opened for the sale of fancy articles, food and
drink. A printing press was in active operation,
and amongst the papers printed was the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

Henry VI. (anno. 1457) sent two private messengers
with fifteen hundred marks, to procure
one of the workmen. These prevailed on
Frederick Corsellis to leave the Printing-house in
disguise; who immediately came over with them,
and first instructed the English in this most
famous Art, at Oxford, in the year 1459.</p>

<p>“Some venturers in the Strand,” says Timbs,
“bought a large ox in Smithfield, to be roasted
whole on the ice; and one, Hodgeson, claimed the
privilege of felling or knocking down the beast as
a right inherent in his family, his father having
knocked down the one roasted on the river in the
Great Frost, 1684, near Hungerford Stairs:
Hodgeson to wear a laced cambric apron, a silver-handled
steel, and a hat and feathers.”</p>

<p>At the thaw a number of persons fell victims to
their rashness, amongst those who lost their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
may be mentioned <em>Doll</em>, the noted pippin woman.
Gay, in his “Trivia,” book ii, thus alludes to her
death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Pippins, she cried, but death her voice confounds,</div>
<div class="verse">And pip, pip, pip, along the ice resounds.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the houses which, at this period, stood
on London Bridge, as well as the bridge itself,
sustained considerable damage.</p>

<p>Thomas Gent, the celebrated printer and
historian, in his Life, relates how he set up a
printing press on the river Ouse at York during
this frost. “In January, 1739,” [1740 n.s.] he
says, “the frost having been extremely intense,
the river became so frozen, that I printed names
upon the ice. It was a dangerous spot on the
south side of the bridge, where I first set up, as it
were, a kind of press&mdash;only a roller wrapped about
with blankets. Whilst reading the verses I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
made to follow the names&mdash;wherein King George
was most loyally inserted&mdash;some soldiers round
about made great acclamation, with other good
people; but the ice suddenly cracking, they
almost as quickly ran away, whilst I, who did not
hear well, neither guessed the meaning, fell to
work, and wondered at them as much for retiring
so precipitately as they did at me for staying; but,
taking courage, they shortly returned back, brought
company, and I took some pence amongst them.
After this I moved my shop to and fro, to the
great satisfaction of young gentlemen and ladies,
and others, who were very liberal on the occasion.”</p>

<p>It will not, we think, be without interest to reproduce
particulars of a palace which was built
solely of ice at this period. “In the year 1740,
the Empress Anne of Russia, caused a palace of
ice to be erected upon the banks of the Neva. This
extraordinary edifice was fifty-two feet in length,
sixteen in breadth, and twenty feet high, and constructed
of large pieces of ice cut in the manner
of freestone. The walls were three feet thick.
The several apartments were furnished with
tables, chairs, beds, and all kinds of household
furniture of ice. In front of this edifice, besides
pyramids and statues, stood six cannon, carrying
balls of six pounds weight, and two mortars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
entirely made of ice. As a trial from one of the
former, a cannon ball, with only a quarter of a
pound of powder, was fired off, the ball of which
went through a two-inch board, at sixty paces
from the mouth of the piece, which remained
completely uninjured by the explosion. The
illumination of this palace at night was astonishingly
grand.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>“All frost or rain from 15th September to 1st
February.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>A severe frost for some weeks. It is recorded in the
<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, 18 December, 1742: “The
frost having continued near three weeks, the
streets in some parts of the city, though there had
been no snow, were rendered very incommodious,
and several accidents happened.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1754</div>

<p>A very severe frost this year, especially at Bath and
in the south-west of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The frost lasted ninety-four days. According to the
<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> it set in on Saturday, 25th
December, 1762. It is thus described: “A most
intense frost with easterly wind, which has since continued,
with very little intermission, until the end
of January. Some experiments have been tried
during the course of it, which prove that on some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
days it was no less severe than that of 1740, though
upon the whole it has not been attended with the
same calamitous circumstances. On Friday, 31st
December, a glass of water placed upon the table
in the open air, in six minutes froze so hard as to
bear 5 shillings upon it; a glass of red port wine
placed upon the same table froze in two hours;
and a glass of brandy in six, both with hard ice.”
It is mentioned that in Cornwall, Wales, and Ireland,
this frost was felt but slightly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767-68</div>

<p>Both these years opened with severe frosts, which
caused provisions to increase greatly in price.
Navigation on the Thames was suspended, and
great damage done to the small craft by the ice.
It is chronicled that “many persons perished by
the severity of the weather, both on the water and
on the shore. During the latter frost, the price
of butchers’ meat grew so exorbitant that the Hon.
Thomas Harley, Lord Mayor, proposed that
bounties should be given for bringing fish to
Billingsgate market; and this plan having been
carried into effect, the distresses of the poor were
greatly alleviated, by the cheap rates at which
the markets were supplied.”</p>

<p>We read in White’s “Selborne,” under date of
January, 1768: “We have had very severe frost
and deep snow this month; my thermometer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
one day 14½ degrees below freezing point, within
doors. The tender evergreens were injured pretty
much. It was very providential that the air was
still, and the ground well covered with snow, else
vegetation in general must have suffered prodigiously.
There is reason to believe that some days
were more severe than any since the year 1739-40.”
The frost this year was very severe in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>The following “Icy Epitaph” is said to be from the

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>The Plymouth correspondent of the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> wrote under date of 16th February, 1782:
“The most intense frost ever known … The
grass, which on Friday was as green and
flourishing as if it had been midsummer, on
Sunday morning seemed to be entirely killed.
This is mentioned by our correspondent as very
unusual in that part of the country; and the snow
lay on the ground in many places.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783-84</div>

<p>The frost lasted eighty-nine days. It commenced
in December, continued through January and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
February, and in March there was snow, and cold
cutting winds. We gather from the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> that it was general. In the February
number it is reported: “From different parts of
the country we have accounts of more persons
having been found dead in the roads, and others
dug out of the snow, than ever was known in any
one year in the memory of man.” On January
6th, “Thames not quite frozen over, but navigation
stopped by ice.” The frost from the 10th to
20th February was extremely severe. The Thames
frozen and traffic crossed in several places.</p>

<p>On the fifth bell of Tadcaster peal is recorded:
“It is remarkable that these bells were moulded
in the great frost, 1783. C. and R. Dalton,
Fownders, York.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for February the following
appears: “From 10th December, 1783, to this
day it has been 63 days’ frost; of these it snowed
nineteen, and twelve days’ thaw, whereof it rained
nine. Had the frost continued at 13 degrees as
on the 31st December during the night, it would
have frozen over the Thames in twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788-89</div>

<p>On the 25th November, 1788, a frost set in which
lasted seven weeks. It is recorded that the thermometer
stood at eleven degrees below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
freezing point in the very midst of the city. The
Thames was frozen below London Bridge, and
the ice on the river assumed all the appearance of
a frost fair. A variety of amusements were provided
for the visitors, including puppet-shows
and the exhibition of wild beasts. In the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> for 1789 the following diary of
remarkable events which transpired during this
frost, is given:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Saturday, January 10, 1789&mdash;Thirteen men
brought a waggon with a ton of coals from Loughborough
in Leicestershire, to Carlton House, as a
present to His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales. As soon as they were emptied into the
cellars, Mr. Weltjie, clerk of the cellars, gave
them four guineas, and as soon as the Prince was
informed of it, his Highness sent them twenty
guineas, and ordered them a pot of beer each
man. They performed their journey, which is 111
miles, in 11 days, and drew it all the way without
any relief.</p>

<p>Monday 12.&mdash;A young bear was baited on the
ice, opposite to Redriff, which drew multitudes
together, and fortunately no accident happened
to interrupt their sport.</p>

<p>Tuesday 13.&mdash;The Prince of Wales transmitted
£1000 to the Chamberlain for the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
poor, during the severe frost.</p>

<p>Saturday 17.&mdash;The captain of a vessel lying off
Rotherhithe, the better to secure the ship’s cables,
made an agreement with a publican for fastening
a cable to his premises; in consequence, a small
anchor was carried on shore and deposited in the
cellar, while another cable was fastened round
a beam in another part of the house. In the
night the ship veered about, and the cables
holding fast, carried away the beam and levelled
the house with the ground; by which accident
five persons asleep in their beds were killed.”</p>

<p>In the Common Place Notes for February, 1789,
is the following:&mdash;“With the new year, new
entertainments commenced, or more properly
speaking, old sports were revived in the neighbourhood
of London. The river Thames, which
at this season usually exhibits a dreary scene of
languor and indolence, was this year the stage on
which there were all kinds of diversions, bear-baiting,
festivals, pigs and sheep roasted, booths,
turnabouts, and all the various amusements of
Bartholomew fair multiplied and improved; from
Putney-bridge in Middlesex, down to Redriff, was
one continued scene of merriment and jollity;
not a gloomy face to be seen, nor a countenance
expressive of want; but all cheerfulness, originating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
apparently from business and bustle. From
this description the reader is not, however, to
conclude that all was as it seemed. The miserable
inhabitants that dwelt in houses on both sides the
river during these thoughtless exhibitions, were
many of them experiencing extreme misery;
destitute of employment, though industrious, they
were with families of helpless children, for want
of employment, pining for want of bread; and
though in no country in the world the rich are
more benevolent than in England, yet their benefactions
could bear no proportion to the wants of
numerous poor, who could not all partake of
the common bounty. It may, however, be
truly said, that in no great city or country on the
continent of Europe, the poor suffered less from
the rigour of the season, than the inhabitants of
Great Britain and London. Yet even in London,
the distresses of the poor were very great;
and though liberal subscriptions were raised for
their relief, many perished through want and cold.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the City of London subscribed
fifteen hundred pounds towards supporting those
persons who were not in the habit of receiving
alms.”</p>

<p>We cull from the <cite>Public Advertiser</cite> of January
15th, 1789, the following piece of drollery, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
shape of an inscription on a temporary building
on the Thames: “This Booth to Let. The
present possessor of the Premises is Mr. Frost.
His affairs, however, not being on a permanent
footing, a dissolution, or bankruptcy may soon
be expected, and a final settlement of the whole
entrusted to Mr. Thaw.”</p>

<p>The printing-press was again at work on the ice,
and in Crowle’s “Illustrated Pennant,” there is a
bill, having a border of type flowers, containing
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The silver Thames was frozen o’er,</div>
<div class="verse">No difference twixt the stream and shore;</div>
<div class="verse">The like no man hath seen before,</div>
<div class="verse">Except he lived in days of yore.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“On the Ice, at the Thames Printing-Office,
opposite St. Catherine’s Stairs, in the severe Frost
January, 1789. Printed by me, William Bailey.”</p>

<p>In the same collection is a stippled engraving
entitled: “A View of the Thames from Rotherhithe
Stairs, during the frost in 1789. Painted by
G. Samuel, and engraved by W. Birch, enamel-painter.”</p>

<p>The end of the Fair we find thus described in
the <cite>London Chronicle</cite> of January 15th, 1789, “Perhaps
the breaking up of the fair upon the Thames
last Tuesday night below bridge, exceeded every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
idea that could be formed of it, as it was not until
after the dusk of the evening that the busy crowd
was persuaded of the approach of a thaw. This,
however, with the crackling of some ice about
eight o’clock, made the whole a scene of the most
perfect confusion; as men, beasts, booths, turnabouts,
puppet-shows, &amp;c., &amp;c., were all in motion,
and pouring towards the shore on each side. The
confluence here was so sudden and impetuous,
that the watermen who had formed the toll-bars
over the sides of the river, where they had broken
the ice for that purpose, not being able to maintain
their standard from the crowd, &amp;c., pulled up
the boards, by which a number of persons who
could not leap, or were borne down by the press,
were soused up to the middle.”</p>

<p>The next issue of the paper records that “on
Thursday, January 15th, the ice was so powerful
as to cut the cables of two vessels lying at the old
Rose Chair, and drive them through the great
arch of London bridge; when their masts becoming
entangled with the balustrades, both were broken
and many persons hurt.” The river remained
frozen for some time after this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795-96</div>

<p>The Antiquarian Society of Newcastle-on-Tyne
recorded that the ice on the river Tyne was
twenty inches thick. The Thames frozen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>We find in “Frostiana” the following particulars
of the curious effect of cold on the feathered
tribe:&mdash;“In February, 1809, a boy, in the service
of Mr. W. Newman, miller, at Leybourne, near
Malling, went into a field, called the Forty Acres,
and saw a number of rooks on the ground very
close together. He made a noise to drive them
away, but they did not appear alarmed; he threw
snow-balls to make them rise, still they remained.
Surprised at this apparent indifference, he went
in among them, and actually picked up twenty-seven
rooks; and also in several parts of the
same field, ninety larks, a pheasant, and a buzzard
hawk. The cause of the inactivity of the
birds, was a thing of rare occurrence in this
climate; a heavy rain fell on Thursday afternoon,
which, freezing as it came down, so completely
glazed over the bodies of the birds, that they
were fettered in a coat of ice, and completely deprived
of the power of motion. Several of the
larks were dead, having perished from the intensity
of the cold. The buzzard hawk being
strong, struggled hard for his liberty, broke his
icy fetters and effected his escape.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813-14</div>

<p>On the evening of the 27th of December, 1813,
a great fog commenced in London, and the greatest
frost of the century set in. We have taken
from a work compiled during the frost, the
following reliable account of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the night of 27th the darkness was so dense
that the Prince Regent, who desired to pay a visit
to the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House,
was obliged to return back to Carlton House, not,
however, until one of his outriders had fallen into
a ditch on the side of Kentish Town. The short
excursion occupied several hours. Mr. Croker, of
the Admiralty, intending to go northward,
wandered in the dark for some hours without
making more than three or four miles progress.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 28th of December, the
Maidenhead coach, on its return from town,
missed the road near Harford Bridge, and was
overturned. Amongst the injured passengers was
Lord Hawarden.</p>

<p>It took, on the 29th of December, the Birmingham
mail nearly seven hours in going a couple of miles
past Uxbridge, or a distance of about twenty miles.</p>

<p>On this and other evenings in London, a couple
of persons with links ran by each horse’s head;
yet with this and other precautions some serious
and many whimsical accidents occurred. Pedestrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
even carried links or lanterns, and a number
who were not provided with lights lost themselves
in the most frequented and at other times well-known
streets. Hackney coachmen mistook the
pathway for the road, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>&mdash;the greatest
possible confusion took place.</p>

<p>The state of the Metropolis on the night of the
31st of December was in consequence truly alarming.
It required both great care and knowledge
of the public streets to enable anyone to proceed
any distance, and those obliged to venture out
carried torches. The usual lamps appeared
through the haze not larger than small candles.
Many of the hackney coachmen led their horses,
and others drove only at walking pace. Until the
3rd of January, 1814, lasted this tremendous fog,
or “darkness that might be felt.”</p>

<p>Immediately on the cessation of the fogs, a
heavy fall of snow commenced. A writer of the
time said, “There is nothing in the memory of
man to equal these falls.” With the exception of
a few short intervals, the snow continued incessantly
for forty-eight hours, and this, too, after
the ground was covered with a condensation,
the result of nearly four weeks’ continued frost.
Nearly the whole of the time the wind blew from
the north and north-east, and was intensely cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of the streets was rendered dangerous
by a thaw which lasted about a day. The mass
of snow and water became so thick, that it was
with difficulty that the carriages could progress
even with the aid of an additional horse each.
Nearly all trades and callings carried on out of
doors were stopped, which considerably increased
the distress of the lower orders. The frost continued
and skating occupied the chief attention
of the people. It will be interesting to furnish
an account of the state of the river Thames
at this period.</p>

<p>Sunday, January 30th: Immense masses of ice
that had floated from the upper parts of the river,
in consequence of the thaw on the two preceding
days, now blocked up the Thames between Blackfriars
and London Bridges, and afforded every
probability of its being frozen over in a day or
two. Some venturous persons even now walked
on different parts of the ice.</p>

<p>Monday, January 31st: This expectation was
realised. During the whole of the afternoon,
hundreds of people were assembled on Blackfriars
and London Bridges, to see several adventurous
men cross and recross the Thames
on the ice; at one time seventy persons were
counted walking from Queenhithe to the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
shore. The frost on Sunday night so
united the vast mass as to render it immovable
by the tide.</p>

<p>Tuesday, February 1st: The floating masses of
ice with which the Thames was covered, having
been stopped by London Bridge, now assumed
the shape of a solid surface over that part of
the river which entered from Blackfriars Bridge
to some distance below Three Crane Stairs, at
the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside. The
watermen, taking advantage of the circumstance,
placed notices at the end of all the streets
leading to the city side of the river, announcing
safe footway over the river, which, as might be
expected, attracted immense crowds to witness so
novel a scene. Many were induced to venture on
the ice, and the example thus afforded soon led
thousands to perambulate the rugged plain, where
a variety of amusements were prepared for their
entertainment.</p>

<p>Among the more curious of these was the ceremony
of roasting a small sheep, which was toasted,
or rather burnt over a coal fire, placed in a large
iron pan. For a view of this extraordinary
spectacle, sixpence was demanded, and willingly
paid. The delicate meat when done was sold at a
shilling a slice, and termed Lapland mutton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Of booths there was a great number, which
were ornamented with streamers, flags, and signs,
and in which there was a plentiful store of those
favourite luxuries, gin, beer and gingerbread.</p>

<p>Opposite Three Crane Stairs there was a
complete and well-frequented thoroughfare to
Bankside, which was strewed with ashes, and
apparently afforded a very safe, although a very
rough path.</p>

<p>Near Blackfriars Bridge, however, the path did
not appear to be equally safe, for one young man,
a plumber, named Davis, having imprudently
ventured to cross with some lead in his hands, he
sank between two masses of ice, to rise no more.
Two young women nearly shared a similar fate,
but were happily rescued from their perilous situation
by the prompt efforts of a waterman. Many
a fair nymph, indeed, was embraced in the very
arms of old Father Thames; three prim young
quakeresses had a sort of semi-bathing near
London Bridge, and when landed on <i lang="la">terra firma</i>,
made the best of their way through the Borough,
amid the shouts of an admiring populace, to their
residence at Newington. In consequence of the
impediments to the current of the river at London
Bridge, the tide did not ebb for some days more
than one half the usual mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Wednesday, February 2nd: The Thames presented
a complete Frost Fair. The grand mall or
walk was from Blackfriars Bridge; this was named
the City-road, and lined on each side with tradesmen
of all descriptions. Eight or ten printing
presses were erected, and numerous pieces
commemorative of the great frost were actually
printed on the ice. Some of these frosty typographers
displayed considerable taste in the
specimens.</p>

<p>At one press an orange-coloured standard was
hoisted, with the watch word “Orange Boven”
in large characters, and the following papers were
issued from it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frost Fair.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Amidst the arts which on the Thames appear,</div>
<div class="verse">To Tell the wonders of this icy year,</div>
<div class="verse">Printing claims a prior place, which at one view</div>
<div class="verse">Erects a monument of That and You.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Another:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“You that walk here, and do design to tell</div>
<div class="verse">Your children’s children what this year befell,</div>
<div class="verse">Come, buy this print, and it will then be seen</div>
<div class="verse">That such a year as this has seldom been.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another of these stainers of paper addressed the
spectators in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Friends, now is your time to support the freedom
of the press. Can the press have greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
liberty? Here you find it working in the middle
of the Thames; and if you encourage us by buying
our impressions, we will keep it going in the true
spirit of liberty during the frost.”</p>

<p>One of the articles printed and sold contained
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Behold the river Thames is frozen o’er,</div>
<div class="verse">Which lately ships of mighty burden bore;</div>
<div class="verse">Now different arts and pastimes here you see,</div>
<div class="verse">But printing claims the superiority.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the above the Lord’s Prayer and several
other pieces were issued from these ice bated
printing offices, and were bought with the greatest
avidity.</p>

<p>Thursday, February 3rd: The adventurers
were still more numerous. Swings, book-stalls,
dancing in a barge, suttling-booths,
playing at skittles, and almost every appendage of
a fair on land was now transferred to the Thames.
Thousands of people flocked to behold this singular
spectacle, and to partake of the various sports and
pastimes. The ice now became like a solid rock
of adamant, and presented a truly picturesque
appearance. The view of St. Paul’s and of the
city with its white foreground had a very singular
effect; in many parts mountains of ice were
upheaved, and these fragments bore a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
resemblance to the rude interior of a stone quarry.</p>

<p>Friday, February, 4th: Every day brought a
fresh accession of “pedlars to sell their wares,”
and the greatest rubbish of all sorts was raked up
and sold at double and treble the original cost.
Books and toys labelled “bought on the Thames”
were seen in profusion. The waterman profited
exceedingly, for each person paid a toll of 2d. or
3d. before he was admitted to the Frost Fair.
Some <i lang="fr">douceur</i> also was expected on your return.
These men were said to have taken £6 each in the
course of a day.</p>

<p>This afternoon, about five o’clock three persons,
an old man and two lads, having ventured on a
piece of ice above London Bridge, it suddenly
detached itself from the main body, and was
carried by the tide through one of the arches.
The persons on the ice, who laid themselves down
for safety, were observed by the boatmen at
Billingsgate, who with laudable activity, put off
to their assistance, and rescued them from their
danger.</p>

<p>One of them was able to walk, but the other
two were carried in a state of insensibility to a
public-house in the neighbourhood, where they
received every attention their situation required.</p>

<p>Many persons were seen on the ice till late at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
night, and the effect by moonlight was singularly
picturesque and beautiful. With a little stretch
of imagination, we might have transported ourselves
to the frozen climes of the north&mdash;to Lapland,
Sweden or Holland.</p>

<p>Saturday, February 5th: The morning of this
day augured rather unfavourably for the continuance
of Frost Fair. The wind had shifted to the
south, and a light fall of snow took place. The
visitors of the Thames, however, were not to be
deterred by trifles. Thousands again returned,
and there was much life and bustle on the frozen
element.</p>

<p>The footpath in the centre of the river was
hard and secure, and among the pedestrians we
observed four donkeys which trotted at a nimble
pace and produced considerable merriment. At
every glance, the spectator met with some
pleasing novelty. Gaming in all its branches
threw out different allurements, while honesty was
out of the question. Many of the itinerant admirers
of the profit gained by E. O. Tables, wheel
of fortune, the garter, &amp;c., were industrious in
their avocations, leaving their kind customers
without a penny to pay their passage over a plank
to the shore. Skittles was played by several
parties, and the drinking tents filled by females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and their companions, dancing reels to the sound
of fiddles, while others sat round large fires,
drinking rum, grog, and other spirits. Tea,
coffee, and eatables were provided in ample order,
while passengers were invited to eat by way of
recording their visit. Several respectable tradesmen
also attended with their wares, selling books,
toys, and trinkets of every description.</p>

<p>Towards evening the concourse became thinned;
rain fell in some quantity; Maister Ice gave some
loud cracks, and floated with the printing presses,
booths, &amp;c., to the no small dismay of publicans,
typographers, &amp;c. In short, this icy palace of
Momus, this fairy frost work, was soon to be
dissolved, and doomed to vanish like the baseless
fabric of a vision, but leaving some “wrecks
behind.”</p>

<p>A short time before the thaw, a gentleman
standing by one of the printing presses, and
supposed to be a limb of the law, handed the
following <i lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i> to its conductor, requesting
that it might be printed on the Thames. The
prophecy which it contains has been most remarkably
fulfilled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“To Madam Tabitha Thaw.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear dissolving dame,&mdash;</p>

<p>Father Frost and Sister Snow have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
boneyed my borders, formed an idol of ice upon
my bosom, and all the Lords of London came to
make merry: now, as you love mischief, treat the
multitude with a few cracks by a sudden visit,
and obtain the prayers of the poor upon both
banks. Given at my press the 5th February,
1814. Thomas Thames.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was evident that a thaw was rapidly taking
place, yet such was the indiscretion and heedlessness
of some persons that one fatal accident
occurred.</p>

<p>Two genteel looking young men fell victims to
their temerity in venturing on the ice above Westminster
Bridge, notwithstanding the warnings of
the waterman. A large mass on which they stood,
and which had been loosened by the flood-tide,
gave way, and they floated down the stream. As
they passed under Westminster Bridge they cried
out most piteously for help. They had not gone
far before they sat down, but, going too near the
edge, they overbalanced the mass, and were precipitated
into the stream, sinking not to appear
again.</p>

<p>This morning, also, Mr. Lawrence, of the
Feathers, in High Timber street, Queenhithe,
erected a booth on the Thames opposite Brook’s
Wharf, for the accommodation of the curious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
At nine at night he left it to the care of two men,
taking away all liquors, except some gin, which
he gave them for their own use.</p>

<p>Sunday, February 6th: At two o’clock this
morning, the tide began to flow with great rapidity
at London Bridge; the thaw assisted the efforts
of the tide, and the booth just mentioned was
hurried along with the quickness of lightning
towards Blackfriars Bridge. There were nine
men in it, and in their alarm they neglected the
fire and candles, which, communicating with the
covering, set it in a flame. The men succeeded in
getting into a lighter which had broken from its
moorings, but it was dashed to pieces against
one of the piers of Blackfriars Bridge, on which
seven of them got, and were taken off safely; the
other two got into a barge while passing Puddle
Dock.</p>

<p>On this day, the Thames towards high tide
(about 3 p.m.) presented a very tolerable idea of
the frozen ocean; grand masses of ice floating
along, added to the great height of the water and
afforded a striking sight for contemplation.</p>

<p>Thousands of disappointed persons thronged the
banks; and many a ’prentice boy and servant
maid sighed unutterable things at the sudden and
unlooked-for destruction of Frost Fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Monday, February, 7th: Large masses of ice
are yet floating, and numerous lighters, broken
from their moorings, are seen in different parts of
the river, many of them complete wrecks. The
damage done to the craft and barges is supposed
to be very great. From London Bridge to Westminster,
twenty thousand pounds will scarcely
make good the losses that have been sustained.</p>

<p>An interesting account of an “Ice Festival”
is given in the pages of <cite>The Champion</cite> of February
6th, 1814. It is chronicled that “Saturday se’nnight
afforded to the inhabitants of Kelso a scene
to which there has been nothing similar for the last
73 years. The late severe weather having frozen
the Tweed completely over, a number of the respectable
inhabitants were desirous of dining on
the ice, and gave orders to Mr. Lander, of the
Queen’s Head Inn, to provide what was necessary
for the occasion. He accordingly erected an
enormous tent in the midst of the river, opposite
Ednam House, and served up an excellent and
hot dinner to a numerous and respectable company.
The tent, which was well heated by stoves,
was surmounted by an orange flag, and the union
flags of England and Holland were displayed on
tables. From forty to fifty sat down to dinner.
The following toasts were drunk with glee:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>‘General
Frost, who so signally fought last
winter for the deliverance of Europe, and who
now supports the present company.’ ‘Both
sides of the Tweed, and God preserve us in the
middle.’ The company were much gratified by
seeing among them an old inhabitant of the town
who was present at the last entertainment given
under similar circumstances, in the winter of the
year 1740, when part of an ox was roasted on the
ice. No accident happened to disturb the pleasures
of the scene.”</p>

<p>From a scene of rejoicing let us turn to a
record of a painful death occurring at this period.
We find in the “Annals of Manchester,” edited
by W. E. A. Axon, (pub. 1886) a note as
follows, under the year 1814:&mdash;“Miss Lavinia
Robinson was found drowned in the Irwell, near
the Mode Wheel, February 8. This young lady,
who possessed superior mental accomplishments,
as well as personal beauty, was engaged to Mr.
Holroyd, a surgeon, but on the eve of her intended
marriage she disappeared from her home in
Bridge Street, December 6th, and owing to the
long frost, her body remained under the ice for a
long period. It appears most probable that the
rash act of the ‘Manchester Ophelia’ was due
to a quarrel in which her betrothed had repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
some slanderous statements respecting her. There
was, however, a strong suspicion that she had
met with foul play. The slanders were shown to
be baseless, and the feeling against Mr. Holroyd
was so strong that he had to leave the town.
(Procter’s ‘Bygone Manchester,’ pages 268, 269.
‘City News Notes and Queries,’ vol. I., p. 265.)”</p>

<p>We extract from the <cite>Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</cite>
the following lines by an anonymous author:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TYNE FAIR;<br />
OR, THE GREAT FROST, JAN. 31, AND FEB. 1, 1814.</p>

<p>The frost here commemorated began about the
8th December, 1813, and continued in a gentle
manner until the morning of the 14th January,
1814, when a stronger frost covered the Tyne
below bridge with a smooth and perfect sheet of
ice, on which, the succeeding day, a number of
people ventured, and skaters, for three successive
days. A partial thaw came on which damped
the ardour of skaters, until the night of the 29th
of January, when again a severe frost considerably
strengthened the ice, and presented a glassy
surface above bridge. On Monday, 31st January,
no less than seven tents were erected on it for the
sale of spirits, and fires kindled on that and the
succeeding day. Parties dined in various of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
tents. The desire of recreation shone forth in
every face. Horse shoes, football, “toss or buy,”
rolly polly, fiddlers, pipers, razor grinders, recruiting
parties, and racers with and without
skates, were all alive to the moment. Hats,
breeches, shifts, stockings, ribbons, and even legs
of mutton, were the rewards of the racers, who
turned night into day; the brilliancy of the full
moon contributing to their diversions until late
beyond midnight. A horse and sledge above
bridge added to the novelty of the scene; and it
is worthy of remark that not one accident of
consequence happened, although thousands ventured
their persons upon the ice. Owing to the
severity of the season, the London Mail for
Friday, the 21st January, and three following
days, was brought to Newcastle on the fifth day,
in the Lord Wellington Coach, with eight horses;
a circumstance quite new to the inhabitants of
canny Newcastle.</p>

<p>The winter very severe in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>On the 7th January a very severe frost set in and
continued a month. This frost was predicted in
“Murphy’s Almanack,” and the fulfilment of the
prediction rendered the publication extremely
popular. A rhyme of the period was as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Murphy hath a weather eye,</div>
<div class="verse">He can tell whatever he pleases,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Whether it will be wet or dry,</div>
<div class="verse">When it thaws and when it freezes.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is recorded in January this year, that the thermometer
at Walton, near Claremont, fell to 14
deg. below zero; at Beckenham it was 13½ deg.
below zero; at Wallingford, 5 deg. below zero;
at Greenwich, 4 deg. below zero; and at Glasgow
1 deg. below zero.</p>

<p>The principal rivers of this country were
frozen over. This winter is frequently called
“Murphy’s winter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1855</div>

<p>On January 16th a very strong frost commenced,
and prevailed for about six weeks. Rivers
were frozen over, and inland navigation was
entirely suspended. The working classes were
subject to many privations on account of the
dearness of food and depression of trade. In
London 10,000 dock porters were out of work,
and such was their sufferings that bread-riots
occurred in the east end of the town. During
this frost traffic was established on the Ure in
Lincolnshire to the distance of thirty-five miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1860-61</div>

<p>Very severe frost from 20th December to 5th
January. Says the <cite>Northern Daily Telegraph</cite>, in a
recent article on “Old Fashioned Winters” “on
the 25th of December, 1860, the thermometer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
London fell to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, which is
17 degrees below freezing point. In the country
the same intensity of cold was felt, and a certain
meteorologist wrote to the <cite>Times</cite> stating that at
Boston, in Nottinghamshire, the temperature
four feet above the ground was 8 degrees below
zero, whilst on the grass it was 13 degrees, or 45
degrees of frost. Fortunately this extreme cold
only lasted three days, and the inconveniences
attending it&mdash;in themselves bad enough&mdash;were not
to be compared with the miseries which accompanied
the great Frost Fair.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1879-1880</div>

<p>In the middle of January, 1880, it was expected
by many that a Frost Fair would once more
be held on the Thames. The last two months of
1879 and the opening month of 1880 were extremely
cold. The President of the Meteorological
Society in his report, 1880, says, “The
period through which we have been passing since
October, 1878, has been one of great cold, in
many respects without precedent during nearly
a quarter of a century. The harvest of 1879 is
recorded as the worst ever known. Shrubs, even
hollies, little short of 100 years old were killed.
Birds were destroyed, Robin Redbreasts took
shelter in our houses; all the rivers in England
were frozen over. It is stated that Major Slack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the 63rd Regiment, at Oakamoor Station,
railway lamps were frozen out, and that rabbits
pushed for food had attacked the oil and grease
on the station crane.” At Chirmside Bridge a
temperature of 6° below zero was observed. Peach
trees 60 years old were killed to the roots. The
evergreens, laurels, rhododendrons, hollies in
many instances, Wellingtonias, and many others
were all killed, and many people frozen to
death. This frost began on the 22nd November,
1879, and on the 2nd February, 1880, a thaw
began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1881</div>

<p>Severe frost from the 7th to the 27th January.
Snow fell daily from the 9th to the 27th of the
month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1886-7</div>

<p>The concluding pages of this work are being
written and printed during a hard frost. The
closing days of the past year, and the early days
of the current year will long be remembered
amongst severe winters.</p>

<p>Perhaps we cannot more fitly close our account
of “Famous Frosts and Frost Fairs,” than by
quoting the following lines from the facile pen of
Edith May, culled from the pages of Hale’s
“Selections of Female Writers,” published in
1853.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
